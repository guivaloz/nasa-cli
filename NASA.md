# NASA

The objective of this [site](https://api.nasa.gov/) is to make NASA data, including imagery, eminently accessible to application developers. This catalog focuses on broadly useful and user friendly APIs and does not hold every NASA API.

## Generate API Key

Signup

- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- How will you use the APIs? (optional)

Save the API key to a `.env` file

    # Your API key for name@example.com is:
    USERNAME=name@example.com
    API_KEY=****************************************

    # You can start using this key to make web service requests. Simply pass your key in the URL when making a web request. Here's an example:
    TEST_URL=https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=****************************************

## Authentication

**You do not need to authenticate** in order to explore the NASA data. However, if you will be intensively using the APIs to, say, support a mobile application, then you should sign up for a NASA developer key.

### Web Service Rate Limits

Limits are placed on the number of API requests you may make using your API key. Rate limits may vary by service, but the defaults are:

-   Hourly Limit: 1,000 requests per hour

For each API key, these limits are applied across all api.nasa.gov API requests. Exceeding these limits will lead to your API key being temporarily blocked from making further requests. The block will automatically be lifted by waiting an hour. If you need higher rate limits, contact us.

### DEMO\_KEY Rate Limits

In documentation examples, the special DEMO\_KEY api key is used. This API key can be used for initially exploring APIs prior to signing up, but it has much lower rate limits, so youâ€™re encouraged to signup for your own API key if you plan to use the API (signup is quick and easy). The rate limits for the DEMO\_KEY are:

- Hourly Limit: 30 requests per IP address per hour
- Daily Limit: 50 requests per IP address per day

### How Do I See My Current Usage?

Your can check your current rate limit and usage details by inspecting the `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` HTTP headers that are returned on every API response. For example, if an API has the default hourly limit of 1,000 request, after making 2 requests, you will receive this HTTP header in the response of the second request:

`X-RateLimit-Remaining: 998`

The hourly counters for your API key reset on a rolling basis.

**Example**: If you made 500 requests at 10:15AM and 500 requests at 10:25AM, your API key would become temporarily blocked. This temporary block of your API key would cease at 11:15AM, at which point you could make 500 requests. At 11:25AM, you could then make another 500 requests.

## API Key Recovery

## Browse APIs

If you find a bug, please note that this page acts as a central catalog and key service for public APIs. It does not hold the actual API code. For bugs in the APIs, please look for a link to the individual API pages and reach out there. For a problem in this page, please add an issue or pull request to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nasa/api-docs).
